# Play By Mail
This organization is for abandoned but still loved play-by-mail game engines.

Our goal is to make this a centralized index of code for the game engines.

If you know of any missing code, please create a new issue in the [TODO](https://github.com/playbymail/TODO) project.
(Yes, we actually named that project "TODO.")
