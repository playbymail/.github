# Play By Mail
Welcome to the Play By Mail archives.
This organization is for abandoned but still loved play-by-mail game engines.

Our goal is to make this a centralized index of code for the game engines.

## Missing A Game?
If you want to add a game to the archives, please let us know.
The easiest way to reach us is by visiting the
[Catalog project](https://github.com/playbymail/catalog)
and then adding an issue with the game's name and location.

A harder way is to visit the Play By Mail Discord server and start a conversation there.
